               The Founding of The Covenant
            </h2>

            <h3>The San'Shyuum</h3>
            <p>
               Over 3,000 years ago, the <b>San'Shyuum</b> encountered the Sangheili for the first time. The San'Shyuum were a nomadic species of space travellers who wandered the stars in search of relics left behind by the ancient and vastly more technologically advanced <b>Forerunners</b>. The believed that the Forerunners had used their technology to ascend to Godhood, and left behind their artifacts so that others could do the same, in a process called <b>The Great Journey</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>The Sangheili</h3>
            <p>
               Eventually, though, they discovered the <b>Sangheili</b>: another species that had created an interstellar civilization with nearly 80 inhabited planets. They were very different from the San'Shyuum; much stronger, and with a much higher affinity toward war and combat. Most importantly, though, they had different beliefs about the Forerunners. The San'Shyuum wanted to study their artifacts and learn from them to improve their own technology. The Sangheili believed that they were sacred and not to be disturbed.
            </p>

            <h3>The War of Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
               Due to the Sangheili's violent nature, this difference quickly led to war. The Sangheili had a significant advantage in terms of martial prowess and sheer numbers, but the San'Shyuum had vastly superior technology, including an impossibly powerful Forerunner ship known as the Dreadnought. As the war raged on, the Sangheili began to realize that it would be impossible to win if they did not adandon their beliefs and start using Forerunner technology. This caused the balance to shift, and the Sangheili started to successfully push the San'Shyuum back.
            </p>

            <h3>The Battle of Sangheilios and The Writ of Union</h3>
            <p>
               With the Sangheili gaining ground, the leader of the San'Shyuum decided he needed to strike a decisive blow and end the war. He took the Dreadnought to Sangheilios, the homeworld of the Sangheili, and began his assault. Though much damage was done to the planet, the Sangheili used their Forerunner weaponry and managed to damage the seemingly-impervious ship and trap it on one of the planet's moons. With the realization that they wouldn't be able to win, along with the recognition that the Sangheili no longer rejected their ideology, the San'Shyuum on the Dreadnought lead a coup against their leader and made the decision to attempt a peaceful resolution. They managed to form a truce, and, after some time, the Sangheili decided to join the San'Shyuum. They created a treaty called <b>The Writ of Union</b>, which brought the war to its official end after 86 years and forming the <b>Covenant</b>, with the common goal of achieving the Great Journey.

            <h2>The Interim</h2>
            
            <h3>The Covenant's </h3>
            <p>
               The early years of the Covenant weren't exactly peaceful. There were several conflicts and civil wars, in which Sangheili who disagreed with the decision to ally with the San'Shyuum broke fought against the Covenant. But the Covenant was powerful enough to crush all rebellion and resistance. In the following few Millenia, the Covenant continued to expand and grow, searching for more Forerunner artifacts. They encountered several more alien species, which they inducted into the Covenant, some willingly and some by force. Among these are the Lekgolo, Kig-Yar, Unggoy, and, most recently, the <b>Jiralhanae</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>The Insurrection and the UNSC</h3>
            <p>
               By the 2500s, Humanity, unified under the <b>United Earth Government</b>, or UEG, had expanded their reach to the stars, colonizing hundreds of planets. However, the rich and powerful Inner Colonies' attempts to control and exploit the Outer Colonies lead to unrest, and eventually open rebellion. As this Insurrection grew, the intensity of the conflict increased, and the <b>United Nations Space Command (UNSC)</b>, the primary military branch of the UEG, were given increasingly more authority and resources to combat them. Eventually, the USNC's power eclipsed that of the UEG itself.
            </p>

            <h3>The Spartan Program</h3>
            <p>
               As the Insurrection continued to grow, the UNSC feared that they might lose control and need to enter open war. To combat this, a secret project known as the <b>SPARTAN-II Program</b> was initiated by the <b>Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI)</b>. The revival of an older project attempting to create augmented soldiers, the SPARTAN Program involved taking children, putting them through intense training, and giving them genetic and physical enhancements as they grew. They were also equipped with heavy powered armor that increased their physical capabilities even further. This created the most powerful soldiers Humanity had ever seen, and they quickly proved themselves devastatingly effective at taking down Insurrectionist groups without anyone even knowing of their existence.

            <h2>The Human-Covenant War</h2>
            <h3>The Great Lie</h3>
            <p>
               After a Forerunner device revealed something strange on an as-of-yet undiscovered planet, an aspiring San'Shyuum leader consulted an "oracle," an artifical intelligence left behind by the Forerunners, to understand the anomaly. The device had revealed that apparently, this planet's surface was covered in <em>millions</em> of forerunner relics, more than anyone had ever seen. The oracle revealed that a key assumption the Covenant held since its inception was wrong. A symbol they interpreted as <b>"Reclamation,"</b> indicating a relic to be collected, was actually <b>"Reclaimer"</b>: the true successors of the Forerunners. The millions of "relics" on the planet were Humans, as they were the ones chosen by the Forerunners to continue their legacy. The leader resolved to hide this information from the rest of the Covenant, taking over as one of the <b>High Prophets</b> and declaring that Humans were to be exterminated in an attempt to cover up the revelation.

            <h3>First Contact</h3>
            <p>
               In the year 2525, Humanity and the Covenant made first contact. It started with a few Human ships disappearing, having been raided by Covenant exploration vessels. This lead to a small skirmish near the Outer Colony <b>Harvest</b>, during which UNSC soldiers realized that the raids had been perpetrated by aliens, rather than Insurrectionists. After the skirmish, The UNSC attempted to make contact with the aliens, setting up a welcoming party on the surface of Harvest. The aliens landed and introduced themselves to Humanity as the Covenant, but things quickly took a turn when a Human was inadvertently killed by one of the aliens. They retreated back to their ship as a fight erupted, and once there, recieved the order that the humans were to be destroyed.
