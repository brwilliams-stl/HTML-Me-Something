            <h2>The San'Shyuum</h2>
            <p>
               Over 3,000 years ago, the <b>San'Shyuum</b> encountered the Sangheili for the first time. The San'Shyuum were a nomadic species of space travellers who wandered the stars in search of relics left behind by the ancient and vastly more technologically advanced <b>Forerunners</b>. The believed that the Forerunners had used their technology to ascend to Godhood, and left behind their artifacts so that others could do the same, in a process called <b>The Great Journey</b>.

            <h2>The Sangheili</h2>
            <p>
               Eventually, though, they discovered the <b>Sangheili</b>: another species that had created an interstellar civilization with nearly 80 inhabited planets. They were very different from the San'Shyuum; much stronger, and with a much higher affinity toward war and combat. Most importantly, though, they had different beliefs about the Forerunners. The San'Shyuum wanted to study their artifacts and learn from them to improve their own technology. The Sangheili believed that they were sacred and not to be disturbed.

            <h2>The War of Beginnings</h2>
            <p>
               Due to the Sangheili's violent nature, this difference quickly led to war. The Sangheili had a significant advantage in terms of martial prowess and sheer numbers, but the San'Shyuum had vastly superior technology, including an impossibly powerful Forerunner ship known as the Dreadnought. As the war raged on, the Sangheili began to realize that it would be impossible to win if they did not adandon their beliefs and start using Forerunner technology. This caused the balance to shift, and the Sangheili started to successfully push the San'Shyuum back.

            <h2>The Battle of Sangheilios and The Writ of Union</h2>
            <p>
               With the Sangheili gaining ground, the leader of the San'Shyuum decided he needed to strike a decisive blow and end the war. He took the Dreadnought to Sangheilios, the homeworld of the Sangheili, and began his assault. Though much damage was done to the planet, the Sangheili used their Forerunner weaponry and managed to damage the seemingly-impervious ship and trap it on one of the planet's moons. With the realization that they wouldn't be able to win, along with the recognition that the Sangheili no longer rejected their ideology, the San'Shyuum on the Dreadnought lead a coup against their leader and made the decision to attempt a peaceful resolution. They managed to form a truce, and, after some time, the Sangheili decided to join the San'Shyuum. They created a treaty called <b>The Writ of Union</b>, which brought the war to its official end after 86 years and forming the <b>Covenant</b>, with the common goal of achieving the Great Journey.
